# Product Authenticator (Blockchian Based Dapp)

Our project is a Product authenticator dApp it is a blockchain based application which we have deployed on the stellar blockchain. It is basically a QRcode scanner.We intent that QRcode will be pasted on every product and the application will tell the whole journey of that particular product by scanning the QRcode. Like from manufacturing to distribution to sellar to the consumer, all stages of manufacturing can be seen through one click.

## Vision of our project

The vision is to reduce fraud in several industries like food, medicine, defence etc. Fake items in the food, medicine, and defense sectors can lead to severe risks and compromised safety. So, with this application, at every block of production(manufacture, distribution, seller) they will have to put complete valid information about the product which will be stored on blockchain application and helps people consume the right safe product.
